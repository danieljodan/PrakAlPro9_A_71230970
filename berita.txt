Overcoming months of opposition by Republicans in Congress, President Biden on Wednesday signed a military aid package worth $95 billion that will arm Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.
"When our allies are stronger, we are stronger," Biden said in remarks at the White House.
Referring to Ukraine, he added, "Im making sure the shipments start right away - in the next few hours, literally, a few hours," Biden said.
The president also reiterated his strong backing for Israel.
"My commitment to Israel, I want to make clear again, is ironclad," the president said. He cited Iran's recent air attack on Israel, which involved more than 300 drones and missiles, though it inflicted only minimal damage.
